PART ONE1984
"CHAPTER 1t was abright coldin April, and the clocks were strik-Lthirteen. Winston Smith; his chin nuzzled into hisbreast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quicklythrough the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though notquickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enter-ingwith him:The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. Atone end of it a coloured poster; toolarge for indoor display,had been tacked to the wallIt depicted simply anenor-mous face, more thana metre wide: the face of aman ofabout forty-five, with ablack moustache and rugged-ly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It wasno usetrying the lift. Even at the best of times it was sel-domworking, and at present the electric current was cutoff'during daylight hours. It was part ofthe economy drivein preparation for Hate Week The flat was seven flights up,and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcerabove his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times onthe way: On eachlanding, opposite the lift-shaft, the posterwith the enormous facefrom the wall.

"ures which had something to do with the production ofpig-iron. The voice came from anoblong metal plaque likedulled mirror which formed part of the surface of theright-hand wall.Winston turneda switch and the voicesank somewhat, though the words were still distinguish-able. The instrument (the telescreen; it was called) could bedimmed, but there was no way ofshutting it off complete-ly. He movedover to the window:smallish, frailthe meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blueoveralls which were the uniform of the party: His hair wasvery fair; his face naturally sanguine; his skin roughened bycoarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the win -ter that had just ended:Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the worldlooked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind werewhirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though thesunwasshining and the skyharsh blue, there seemedto be no colour inanything, except the posters that wereplastered everywhere.The blackmoustachio d facedown from every commanding corner: There was one onthe house-front immediatelyopposite.

The penwas anarchaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures,andhe had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty,simply because of athat the beautiful creamy paperdeserved to be written on witha real nib instead ofscratched with an ink-pencil.

Either the future would resemble the present, in whichcase it would not listen to him: or it would be different fromit, and his predicament would be meaningless.For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper: Thetelescreen had changed over to strident military music.

Winston was justhis placein one of the middle rows when two people whom he knewby sight, but had neverto, cameunexpectedly intothe room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed inthe corridors. He did not know her name; but he knew thatshe worked in the Fiction Department: Presumably__sincehe had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying aspanner-~she had some mechanical job on one of the nov-el-writing machines.

Winston had disliked her from thevery first moment of seeing her: He knew the reason: It wasbecause of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold bathsand community hikes and general clean-mindedness whichshe managed to carry about with her: He disliked nearly allwomen, and especially the young and pretty ones It was al-ways the women, and above all the young ones, who werethemostbigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowersofslogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unortho-FREE EBooKs AT PLANET EBooK.COMdiarythingthey -tretakingspoken"
"But this particular girl gave him the impression ofbeing more dangerous than most: Once whenin the corridor she gave himsidelong glance whichseemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filledhim with black terror: The idea had even crossed his mindthat she might be an agent of the Thought Police: That, itwas true, was very unlikely: Still, he continued to feel a pe-culiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well ashostility, whenever she was anywhere near him:The other person was a man named O Brien, a memberof the Inner Party and holder of some post s0 importantand remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature_A momentary hushover the group of people roundthe chairs assaw the black overalls of an Inner Partymember approaching: OBrien was aburly man withthick neck anda coarse,humorous, brutal face.

But at any ratehe had the appearance of being a person that you couldtalk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and gethim aloneWinston had never made the smallest effort toverify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. Atthis moment OBrien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that itwasnearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided tointhe Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate wasover: He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a coupleof places away:A small, sandy-haired woman who workedin the next cubicle to Winston was between them.

"medium of expression for the world-view and mental hab-its proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all othermodes of thought impossible. It was intended that whenNewspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeakforgotten,heretical thought-~that is,thought divergingthe principles of Ingsoc_should be literally unthink-able, at least so far as thought is dependent o words Itsvocabulary wasSoconstructedastogive exactandof-ten very subtle expression to every meaning thatPartymember could properly wish to express, whileexcludingall other meanings and also the possibility of arriving atthem by indirect methods.This was done partly by theinvention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating unde-sirable words and by stripping such words as remained ofunorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all second-ary meanings whatever: To give a single example. The wordFREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used insuch statements asThisis free from lice' or  This fieldis free from weeds. It could not be used in its old sense of'politically free'orintellectually free' sincepolitical and in-tellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, andwere therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from thesuppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vo-cabulary wasregarded as an end in itself,and no word thatcould be dispensed with was allowed to survive.

It didnot containgrammatical error; but it expressedpalpa -ble untruth-~i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, orstrength: The concept of political equality no longer existed,and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purgedout of the word EQUAL. In 1984, when Oldspeak was stillthe normalmeans of communication, the danger theo-retically existed that inNewspeak words one mightremember their original meanings.
